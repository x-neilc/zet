SQL Injection is a common way of exploiting web pages that use `SQL Statements` that 
retrieve and store user input data. If configured incorrectly, one can use this attack 
to exploit the well-known `SQL Injection` vulnerability, which is very dangerous. There 
are many different techniques of protecting from SQL injections, some of them being 
input validation, parameterized queries, stored procedures, and implementing a WAF (Web 
Application Firewall) on the perimeter of the server's network. However, instances can 
be found where none of these fixes are in place, hence why this type of attack is 
prevalent, according to the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) list 
of web vulnerabilities.
